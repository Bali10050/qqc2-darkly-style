# QQC2 Breeze Style

This is a pure Qt Quick/Kirigami Qt Quick Controls style. Unlike QQC2-Desktop-Style, it does not depend on Qt Widgets and the system QStyle. It looks like the KDE Visual Design Group's vision for Breeze.

It behaves similar to how the Qt Basic, Fusion and Material QQC2 styles behave, but with various extra features to improve the user experience.

The performance, loading times and RAM usage should be generally competitive with the Qt Fusion and Material QQC2 styles.
